### First Assessment :: Write a python program to add two numbers.

# first = input("Enter first value: ")
# second = input("Enter second value: ")
# sum = float(first) + float(second)
# print("sum of two numbers is: ", sum)

### Second Assessment :: Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z.

# a = input("Enter a value : ")
# b = input("Enter b value: ")
# c = int(a) % int(b)
# print("The value is: ", c)

### Third Assessment :: Check the type of variable assigned using input () function.

# d = input("Enter a value: ")
# print(d, type(d))

## Fourth Assessment :: Use comparison operator to find out whether ‘a’ given variable a is greater than ‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80

# e = input("Enter e value: ")
# f = input("Enter f value: ")

# print(int(e) > int(f))

### Fifth Assessment :: Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user.

# g = input("Enter g value : ")
# h = input("Enter h value: ")
# print((int(g)+int(h))/2)

### Sixth Assessment :: Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.

i = int(input("Enter i value: "))
j = i ** 2  # i^2 not allowed in python
k = i * i
l = pow(i, 2)
print("Square of the number is: ", j)
print(f"The square of {i} is {k}.")
print(f"square of {k}")
